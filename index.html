                        It is required to be active during guild wars. If there is a reason you will not be able to log in, let someone know BEFORE the war begins, and it will be excused. <i>Inactive members during the guild war will be kicked our at the end of the war.</i>

                        We declare war on the hour the guild war starts, and then every 2 hours. <i>Declaring war randomly will get you kicked out at the end of the war.</i>

                        Everyone is required to change their name to RK during guild war. This makes it difficult for opposing guild to identify easy targets.

                        We do not require gems to be spent, but it is appreciated. Respect the choices of your guild mates to gem or not.

                We rank officers by total number of attacks during guild war, not by points, to encourage everyone to attack guardians and sentinels. The ranks are awarded in the following order:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Guild Champion (1 seat) - Attributed to the member with the most attacks at the end of guild war.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        High-commanders (9 seats) - Attributed to the members with the most attacks, following the guild champion, at the end of guild war.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        High-commanders (2 seats) - Attributed to the top 2 gold contributing members during the last week.
